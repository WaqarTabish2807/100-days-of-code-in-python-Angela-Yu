# Udemy Angela Yu's course that has 100 projects for students to make each day with classes with duration of 1~2 hours each day.
This repository will store all the related projects. If you are intrested in any code files, please run the code in an IDE for python, although I recommend running it in replit as some modules are imported based on the website.
